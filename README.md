# Notes Concurrency in Go

In six chapters building block, patterns, scaling issues and internals are discussed.

## 1 Intro

It's hard.

### Coffman Conditions

If at least one of the conditions is not true, we can *prevent* deadlocks (but
it's hard to reason about code).

### Livelocks

Busy, no progress (two or more process attempt preventing a deadlock without
coordination). Subset of Starvation.

### Starvation

One or more greedy process. Livelock a special case, since no process makes
progress. Example: polite worker, keep critical section short.

### Is it safe?

Reduce API ambiguity, be explicit or do not expose concurrency at all.

### Simplicity in the Face of Complexity

> with Goâ€™s concurrency primitives, you can more safely and clearly express
your concurrent algorithms.

[Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in
Go](https://songlh.github.io/paper/go-study.pdf) suggested otherwise, no?


## 2 Modeling

### Concurrency != Parallelism

> Concurrency is a property of the code; parallelism is a property of the
> running program.

* code **is** not parallel &mdash; we hope it will **run** in parallel

> If you wanted to write concurrent code, you would model your program in terms
> of threads and synchronize the access to the memory between them.

### What is CSP?

* 1978
* input and output are overlooked properties of (concurrent) programs
* process calculus

A process requires input to run. Other processed might consume output.

### How does it help?

Goroutines may help shift thinking about *parallelism* to thinking about
*concurrency*.
