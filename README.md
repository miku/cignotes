### Coffman Conditions

If at least one of the conditions is not true, we can *prevent* deadlocks (but
it's hard to reason about code).

### Livelocks

Busy, no progress (two or more process attempt preventing a deadlock without
coordination). Subset of Starvation.

### Starvation

## Modeling

## Building blocks

## Patterns

## Scale

## Internals
