# Notes Concurrency in Go

In six chapters building block, patterns, scaling issues and internals are discussed.

## 1 Intro

It's hard.

### Coffman Conditions

If at least one of the conditions is not true, we can *prevent* deadlocks (but
it's hard to reason about code).

### Livelocks

Busy, no progress (two or more process attempt preventing a deadlock without
coordination). Subset of Starvation.

### Starvation

One or more greedy process. Livelock a special case, since no process makes
progress. Example: polite worker, keep critical section short.

### Is it safe?

Reduce API ambiguity, be explicit or do not expose concurrency at all.

### Simplicity in the Face of Complexity

> with Goâ€™s concurrency primitives, you can more safely and clearly express
your concurrent algorithms.

Go](https://songlh.github.io/paper/go-study.pdf) suggested otherwise, no?
